# Hi, I'm Dongxu Shen ðŸ‘‹

I am a B.S. student in **Artificial Intelligence** at **HKUST (Guangzhou)**.  
My research interests focus on **large-scale image analysis** and **Whole Slide Image (WSI) processing**.  
I am particularly interested in developing efficient methods for **high-resolution patch representation**, **3D imaging**, and **Whole Slide image**.
